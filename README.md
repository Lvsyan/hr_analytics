# Description

I made this dashboard with Tableau for an exercise of my specialization of Business Intelligence, 
I've been practising Tableau and PowerBI.

## Filters

I only used Education filter to see what type of knowledge or course did the students made. 
Also with Tableau optiones we can see what we look for with departments.

## Dashboard

Department wise Attrition -> we can see the different appartments how are distributed from each other being Sales the bigger one

No of Employee by Age group -> number of the employeers group by age, we can analize that between 28-32 is the age where people is moving around

Job Satisfaction Rating -> how satisfaction per role is getting, we see that sales executive are the ones that are more satisfied

Education Field wise Attrition -> we can see that life sciences is the education with most numbers being medical second

Attrition Rate by Geneder for different Age group -> different between the gender for group of ages

## Conclusion

I think one of the important things we can take away from this report is the abysmal average in 
ages that we had not previously discovered. The fact that the vast majority of ages are between 24 and 36 years old, 
being able to know that youth is broad.

## Programs
